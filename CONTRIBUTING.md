# Contributing to agx

We love your input! We want to make contributing to `agx` as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We use GitHub Flow

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Ideas & Questions -> GitHub Discussions
Have a vague idea? A "what if"? A question about how something works?
👉 **Start in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mndrk/agx/discussions)**

This keeps our Issue tracker clean and focused on actionable items.

### 2. Bugs & Concrete Features -> GitHub Issues
Found a bug? Have a specific, actionable feature request?
👉 **Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/mndrk/agx/issues)**

**Please use our Issue Templates:**
- **Bug Report:** Tell us what happened, what you expected, and how to reproduce it.
- **Feature Request:** Describe the problem you are solving, not just the solution.

### 3. The Label System
We use labels to communicate status and intent. Key labels to know:

*   **Type:** `bug`, `feature`, `question`, `proposal`
*   **Status:**
    *   `needs-repro`: We can't fix it if we can't see it.
    *   `needs-design`: Good idea, but needs a plan before coding.
    *   `blocked`: Waiting on something else.
    *   `help-wanted`: We'd love your help on this!
    *   `good-first-issue`: Great for new contributors.
*   **Reality Checks:** `won't-fix`, `out-of-scope`.

### 4. Pull Requests
1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes.
4.  Make sure your code lints.
5.  Issue that Pull Request!

## Triage Cadence
We triage issues **weekly**. If you don't hear back immediately, don't worry—we'll get to it.
